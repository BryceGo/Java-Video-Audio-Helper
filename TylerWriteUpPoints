For the slider:

    We decided that for the purpose of viewing frames with sound in videos that it would be advantageous to be able to
start and stop a video anywhere that the user chooses. For this we added a slider option that uses a value change
listener to update which frame in the video we play or start from. This slider is disabled whenever the media being
displayed is either a single frame video or a still image.

For the video support:

    In order to support video media in the application we used the JavaFX VideoCapture class to load in a video as a
dynamic Mat array. This would allow similar options to be performed on video media and still images. This also worked
well with the slider implementation as it is easy to change a "current position" in an array.

For the open file support:

    For the open file support we used the JavaFX FileChooser class and set restrictions on file types selected. The
purpose for this decision rather than implementing our own fie selector is that this allows for selection of media
anywhere in the user's file system.
